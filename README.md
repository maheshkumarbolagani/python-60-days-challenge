Problem Statement
The program asks for four things:
- Full Name
- Email ID
- Mobile Number
- Age
- 
  It checks each one based on certain rules. If everything’s good, you get “User Profile is VALID.” If not, you get “User Profile is INVALID.

   
Validation Rules
  
   - Full Name: Has to have at least two words. Can’t start or end with a space.
   - Email ID: Needs at least one @ and one . Can’t start with @.
  -  Mobile Number: Exactly 10 digits, only numbers, and shouldn’t start with 0.
  -  Age: Must be over 18 and no more than 60.


  
Algorithm
- Ask for your full name, email, mobile number, and age.
- Check the full name for the right number of spaces and no leading or trailing spaces.
- Check the email for @ and . and make sure it’s not starting with @.
- Check the mobile number for length, digits, and starting digit.
- Make sure the age is in the right range.
- Print out if the profile is valid or not.
